# Bargain
Web application for sharing price bargains!
This is a web application that I am currently working on. The application's soluition is made according to onion architecture.

The first photo shows the main part of the page, where there is a list of all the items added. The list is sorted by date, and at the top is the most recent bargain added.

Users can select a category of items to limit the display of the list to one category of interest.

Anyone can add their bargains to the site. To do so, the user must fill in all the required fields, upload a photo(s) and click "Create an occasion".

When the user does something wrong, such as uploading an invalid file. Validation will not allow the user to add this item to the database and will show information about what was wrong.
